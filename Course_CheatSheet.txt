Lecture 118 is build of SSIS package

from lecture 121 - basic table naming structure and the Row Number column
CREATE TABLE [RAW_FakeNames_03302019_0700] (
[RowNumber] int identity(1,1),

Lecture 133 & 134
really good class on automatically cleaning data on upload and seperating good and bad records. 
Q&A - right click to add annotations to a build package in SSIS
Open designer on an SSIS solution; from solution explorer click on .dtsx file then use view
from toolbar and choose designer. 

Lecture 139 HOMEWORK
Good run through of SSIS package with conditional splits

Lecture 143 SQL for datascience
Here Kirill is running through basics of SQL server management studio.
How to import data quickly (non-SSIS). 
- from flat file -> destination (Microsoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server)
(note: different than what you do at work where you use the client) 

Lecture 150 Implicit data conversion
Mostly covering varchar (text) conversions (implicit) to other types. 
See PDF P12-SQL-Server-Data-Type-Conversion-Chart.pdf

Lecture 151 Explicit data conversion
cast - example cast text as a number with decimals (float)
and 
convert - pretty much the same but better for dates

Lecture 157 - TETLT - Transform, Extract, Transform, Load, Transform
the next step here is moving data from TXT format from upload into proper formats; int, date, etc...
we'll use stored procedures to take data from RAW DB to what we'll call a working DB
and the final step is possible with making some sort of view or combination of tables 
that can then be used with R, Python, Tableau

Lecture 160 - Stored Procedures
in Programmability folder you can create a Stored Procedure
See saved SQL in Customer Listing folder
Stored procedure is stored in DB

Lecture 170's
more work with stored procedures. 

Lecture 207-210 is Dataprep Section Homework, really good stuff.

Lecture 10 start of Tableau - I decided to use the 'Public' option as opposed to the 'Trial' version, Kirill said it was the same.
