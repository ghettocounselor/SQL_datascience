Section 3 Data Prep Lecturre 139

HOMEWORK request;
three factors needed - last three columns Blood Type, Kilograms and Centimetttters
It's not really clear what the homework assignment is here ??

Step 1 - download data provided, place into new folder structure created for homework and make a few copies in Prepared data folder.
-- Kirill likes to make a .txt file for xls use (I'm not sure why, maybe just a habit)
-- NotePad++ version to look at in NotePad ++
-- XLS version to look at in XLS (on Mac) - change all columns to Text type
-- copy of orginal data, presumably we'll be editing.
-- roughly 100,000 rows

Step 2 - data review
-- XLS 
--- 72 rows don't have blood type
--- 130 rows don't have kg
--- 243 rows don't have centimeters
--- any number of other rows with the three items above have eroneous information
--- row 70 screwed

Step 3 -- fix a few things in xlsss
- column K birthday change to yyyy-mm-dd format

Step 4 - SSIS package
-- had to go back to notepad ++ and fix name columns to last and first name
-- normal steps
--- flat file source for initial pull
--- conditional split on missing BT, KG, CM
--- second conditional split on shifted items into column 18
--- setup of folders and flat files to capture these
--- OLE DB connection setup for table build
	set AlwaysUseDefaultCodePage to True
--- REVIEW PACKAGE EXECUTION ERRORS
-- NOTE WHERE - under the display where you see the components of the SSIS package you can click on the items to edit the parameters. Double clicking on them does not work.
-- note issue with address
-- before fix truncateeed (clear) table
-- added to the bad data conditional split a check of address > 200 characters - clearly something wrong there
-- adjusted initial import of data to include 5000 characters in Address (or allow that many depending on how you think about it)

-- lastly after it loads properly go to control flow in SSIS and disable
