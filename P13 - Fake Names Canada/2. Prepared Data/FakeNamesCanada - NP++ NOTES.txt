file is tab delimited
200,000
xls can open files up to 1 mil + rows so we are good. 


Notes from inspection;

- 1000 characters per row will be fine

we have interest rate with % signs

we have balance in $ with $ and ,'s

we have birthday with MM/DD/YY
note 
zipcode in canada is odd ;)

noted a few odd characters like ? in street address

look for stuff where columns are blank

-- look ok didn't do thorough job of this

fixes in XLS

-- my xls on MAC imports date correctly as MDY not 
text
but we need to custom format to YYYY-MM-DD in xls

-- balance reformat to number no $ with 2 decimal points again

MAC xls imports as general type, in course Kirill uses text to columns

to change the type to General before formatting. 

-- interest rate we formatted as a number with 4 decimals which converted to 

a decimal version of the original stated % (100 * whatever version)
