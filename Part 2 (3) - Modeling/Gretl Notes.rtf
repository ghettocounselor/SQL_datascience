Years of Experience and Salary (30 rows)

Simple Linear Regression from Gretl;

Model 1: OLS ordinary least squares, using observations 1-30
Dependent variable: Salary

                    coefficient   std. error   t-ratio    p-value 
  ----------------------------------------------------------------
Independent variables;  
  const               25792.2       2273.05      11.35    5.51e-012 ***
  YearsExperience     9449.96       378.755      24.95    1.14e-020 ***
Interpretation of above; 
At zero years of experience you'd make 25792.2 (the coefficient) aka where the line would hit zero.
For each year of experience you'd make an additional 9449.96 in the Model's world.
e-020 ; means 10 to the power of - 20 AKA a really small number which means there is a dependency

Schwarz criterion    609.6847   Hannan-Quinn         607.7788
Interpretation of above;
R-squared and Adjusted R-squared are the things we are interested in here. 

Lecture 52 - 61
Noted caveats - assumptions with Linear Regressions
1. Linearity
2. Homoscedasticity
3. Multivariate normality
4. Independence of errors
5. Lack of multicollinearity

We will be building a Geo-Demographic Segmentation Model later on.
