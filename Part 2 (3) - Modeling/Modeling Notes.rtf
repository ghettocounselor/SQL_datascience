Early lectures are good introduction to some statistical understanding of basic ideas such as regression. 
The lectures are well done. 

In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between 
a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression

In statistics, simple linear regression is a linear regression model with a single explanatory variable.
That is, it concerns two-dimensional sample points with one independent variable and one dependent variable 
(conventionally, the x and y coordinates in a Cartesian coordinate system) and finds a linear function 
(a non-vertical straight line) that, as accurately as possible, predicts the dependent variable values 
as a function of the independent variables. The adjective simple refers to the fact that the outcome 
variable is related to a single predictor.

Simple_linear_regression is commonly used in machine learning.

R-squared (sq) is basically the goodness of fit; meaning how well does the regression line represent the variables; how good does it fit. 

Lecture 45 
Adjusted R squared (sq) seeks to allow us to continue to add more variables and decrease R-sq

R2 (squared) = 1 - SSres / SStot
The adjusted R-squared is a modified version of R-squared that has been adjusted for the number of 
predictors in the model. The adjusted R-squared increases only if the new term improves the model 
more than would be expected by chance. It decreases when a predictor improves the model by 
less than expected by chance.
