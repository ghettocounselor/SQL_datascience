Basically we're looking for is something simply random or is there a distinct difference in
the items being tested. 

BIG NOTE: in our test of we're checking the variable against exited or not exited we are
not testing, for instance, male vs female. The online test references 'sample 1' or '2' as 'more'
successful. 

Rules to remember; Lecture 36 https://www.udemy.com/datascience/learn/lecture/3527140
1. Probability of independence - this is what this Chi-Squared test is all about
2. NOT the relationship between variables - example; we are not telling the significance
of the difference between variables (gender and exiting) only independence (not just random)
3. Cannot use %'s we need absolute values
4. Categories need to be exclusive ex; you either exited or you didn't, you cannot have
items in the test in both of your groups. 
5. Never exclude any (even 1) of the outcomes; although you can excluse entire categories, ex; we 
could in our data test France vs Germany and leave out Spain. This was not well described. 
6. Minimum of 5 observations in each cell
