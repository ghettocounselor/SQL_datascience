Project 2 of Section 3 data prep
Basically Kirill is walking us through various problems we'll have with data.

So far these range from;
- date formatting - we fix in Excel
- adjustment errors in Excel - manually edited some data, deleted others
- extra long text - adjust in ETL process by expanding field size
- can adjust for data truncation in SSIS we changed all field lengths to 1000 and feedback to 5000
- we learned to do two conditional splits in our SSIS package to cleanse some things before loading only the good data
-- spit out two collections of unuseable data - 1. missing data we need and 2. additional problems in data not previously created.
