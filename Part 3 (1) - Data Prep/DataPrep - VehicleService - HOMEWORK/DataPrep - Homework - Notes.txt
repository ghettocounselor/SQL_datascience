The Challenge, as explained in homework word doc.
Vehicle Service Challenge

1. The CustomerID field does not contain duplicate records.
2. There are 5 errors in the data. Find them.
3. Suggest explanations how each of the errors could have occurred and 
what you think is the best way to fix each one.
4. You know that the total projected revenue 
for 2016 equals: $419,896,187.87. You need the uploaded data to 
match this value (this means that every row is important).

Notes;
- imported .txt file into MAC XLS
-- or tried too but file to big for one sheet. 
-- xls can only hold 1,048,576 rows we have a little over 1,050,000 rows :) 
-- looking through NP ++ and the Mil + rows that did import the data looks generally OK
-- file is semicolon separated
- Decided to just pull into DB via SSIS package
-- it errored
- Back to file
-- broke into two pieces
-- pull back into XLS and adjust data and $$ rows as normal Text to Columns then format
-- save each as csv
-- put back together
-- make SSIS package
--- note one file has an extra column
--- 5 ISSUES discovered
1 --- one row 2738818 in data had a ; instead of a decimal place which gave us an extra column - was excluded in SSIS package
2 --- one row 676802 in data had a $ instead of a decimal place so we pulled this in SQL 
3 --- one customer number was duplicaed (with two dif cars)
